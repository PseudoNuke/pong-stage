# Interaction Sequences

## Startup Sequence

-The pong game opens and shows the Main Menu module.
Based on user inputs it either starts the game as per Start module,
or goes to the level selection as per Level module,
or quits the game as per Quit module

## Movement Initiation

-The Start module begins by positioning the ball at the center
of the area and giving it an initial velocity in the horizontal
and vertical direction. As the game proceeds, the Ball Direction
module helps in giving the ball its required direction.

## One score

-The Start module initializes the score counter to 0. The Score module
helps in keeping track of the player's score while the game is going on.
The Stop module helps in storing the player's score corresponding to the
